Oh, I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling anxious and low on energy. That sounds tough, and it's completely valid to feel that way sometimes. It's important to acknowledge those feelings and be kind to yourself.

When you say anxious, can you tell me a bit more about what that feels like for you? And is there anything specific that you think might be contributing to these feelings?
